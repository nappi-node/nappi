## Important note

This is a _Work In Progress_ project that I'm just starting to work on now.
It is on Github and NPM just because I wanted also to check how deployment to
NPM is done right, and it's public because why would I want to pay for it now?

Having said that, the project is _totally useless_ right now. I just noticed 14
downloads in NPM -- please don't do that, you're wasting your time.

Please come back in 4-5 months.
